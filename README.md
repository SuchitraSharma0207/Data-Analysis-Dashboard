# HR Analytics Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Power BI)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition trends within an organization using HR data. By visualizing key metrics and patterns, the dashboard helps HR professionals and management identify factors contributing to attrition, monitor workforce composition, and develop data-driven strategies for employee retention.

## Dataset Used

## Business Questions (KPIs) Addressed
The dashboard is designed to answer several key HR questions:
What is the overall attrition rate?
How many employees have left the company?
What are the demographics of attrition (age, gender, education)?
Which job roles and departments have the highest attrition?
How does salary range and years at company influence attrition?
What is the average age, salary, and tenure of employees?

## Process
The dataset was cleaned and categorized into key segments such as age groups, education levels, salary slabs, and job roles.
Calculated key metrics like attrition rate, average age, and salary.
Microsoft Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations, including charts and tables to highlight attrition patterns. 
Filters and slicers were added for user-friendly interactivity and deeper analysis by department or gender.

## Project Insights
Most attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group and among employees with life sciences backgrounds.
Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest attrition by job role.
Employees with a salary up to 5K leave more frequently, indicating compensation may be a contributing factor.
A significant number of employees leave within their first year, emphasizing the need for better onboarding or early engagement strategies.

## Final Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard reveals critical attrition trends that can guide strategic HR decisions. High attrition in certain roles and demographics highlights the need for targeted retention strategies, competitive compensation, and improved workplace engagement. With this dashboard, HR leaders can proactively address workforce challenges and improve overall organizational health.
